[Neg](https://github.com/jmettraux/neg) 1.1.0 is out. Neg is a small PEG parser library, very un-awesome and naive. One could say it's a small brother of [Parslet](http://kschiess.github.com/parslet/).

The bulk of the work from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0 was the removal of the "UnconsumedInputError".

Consider this parser:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
class BlockParser < Neg::Parser

  parser do

    blocks == nl? + block + (nl + block) * 0 + nl?

    block == sp? + `begin` + sp + _('a-z') + nl + body + sp? + `end`
    body  == ((line | block) + nl) * 0
    line  == sp + `line`

    nl  == _("\s\n") * 1
    nl? == _("\s\n") * 0
    sp  == _(" ") * 1
    sp? == _(" ") * 0
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

It's meant for parsing begin blocks, nested or given in succession:

{% highlight ruby %}
# simple
begin a
end

# nested
begin a
  begin b
  end
end

# sequence
begin a
end
begin b
end
{% endhighlight %}

So far, so good. But the parser becomes kind of unhelpful when it's fed something like:

{% highlight ruby %}
begin a
  begin b
  end
end
begin c
  begin d
end
{% endhighlight %}

Neg 1.0.0, would just raise an UnconsumedInputError and say something like "I could parse that, but there's trailing input I couldn't parse, it starts at 'begin c'".

Neg 1.1.0, will instead raise a ParseError stating it couldn't find the end somewhere after "begin c".

This 1.1.0 also introduce a #flattened_results helper for the Translator. It's used in the [JSON sample](https://github.com/jmettraux/neg/blob/ca1b14a498ef43454acf6adacff394d04d023fca/spec/sample_json_parser_spec.rb), the [arith sample](https://github.com/jmettraux/neg/blob/ca1b14a498ef43454acf6adacff394d04d023fca/spec/sample_arith_spec.rb) and the [scheme sample](https://github.com/jmettraux/neg/blob/ca1b14a498ef43454acf6adacff394d04d023fca/spec/sample_scheme_spec.rb). It comes in handy when translating for a parse rule like:

{% highlight ruby %}
  array == `[` + (value + (`,` + value) * 0) * 0 + `]`
{% endhighlight %}

It flattens alls the values into a single array.

{% highlight ruby %}
  on(:array) { |n| n.flattened_results }
{% endhighlight %}
