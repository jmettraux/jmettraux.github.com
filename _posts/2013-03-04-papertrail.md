On Saturday, I presented a few slides about [PaperTrail](http://papertrailapp.com) at [Hiroshima.rb](http://hiroshimarb.github.com).

Not very Ruby-centric, but people were intrigued by a solution centralizing logs and providing excellent tools for accessing them.

The other talks went from the subtleties of Symbol in Ruby 2.0 to a very sweet Tetris implementation via Webrick tricks and BDD explorations.

Many of the people coming to this user group try to present something, the trend has being going stronger the last few months, it's a pleasure to attend.
